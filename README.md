# RPS-Multiplayer

https://ewgalassi.github.io/RPS-Multiplayer/

This is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between two opponents.  It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Firebase.

### How to use it

This is a multiplayer game, so you will either need a friend to play or you will need to use two separate browser tabs to play against yourself (very boring).  You type in the name of your player and when there are two players you will receive the choices of rock, paper, or scissors.  Once both players have chose, you will be informed if you have won or lost that round.  The rounds will tally for each loss and win.  There is a chat function so that you may communicate your superiority to your opponent.
